#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Software engineering is essential in today's digital world as it ensures the development of reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions. It plays a crucial role in various industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and communication, by enabling automation, enhancing productivity, and improving user experience. Through structured design, testing, and maintenance, software engineering ensures the security, functionality, and longevity of applications, making modern technology more accessible and effective.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. NATO Conference (1968) – Introduced "software engineering" to address the growing complexity of software development.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s) – Improved software modularity and reusability through concepts like encapsulation and inheritance.

3. Agile Manifesto (2001) – Revolutionized software development with iterative, flexible, and customer-focused methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


2. Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer
Role: Designs, develops, and maintains software applications.
Responsibilities:
Writing, testing, and debugging code.
Implementing software solutions based on project requirements.
Collaborating with designers and engineers to improve functionality.
Maintaining and updating existing software.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Role: Ensures the software meets quality standards before release.
Responsibilities:
Designing and executing test cases.
Identifying and reporting bugs or defects.
Automating testing processes for efficiency.
Ensuring software reliability, security, and performance.
3. Project Manager
Role: Oversees the software development process and team coordination.
Responsibilities:
Planning and managing project timelines, budgets, and resources.
Communicating with stakeholders to align project goals.
Ensuring tasks are completed on schedule.
Risk assessment and problem-solving to keep the project on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – IDEs streamline software development by providing essential tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. They enhance productivity, reduce errors, and support multiple programming languages. Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.

Version Control Systems (VCS) – VCS tracks and manages changes in code, allowing collaboration, rollback, and version history management. It prevents code conflicts and ensures a stable development workflow. Examples: Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Debugging & Code Complexity – Writing and maintaining complex code can lead to bugs and inefficiencies.
Strategy: Use debugging tools, write clean modular code, and follow best coding practices.

2.Keeping Up with Technology – Rapid advancements require continuous learning.
Strategy: Stay updated through online courses, industry blogs, and hands-on practice with new technologies.

3.Collaboration & Communication – Miscommunication can lead to project delays and errors.
Strategy: Use clear documentation, collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira), and regular team meetings.

4.Managing Deadlines & Workload – Tight schedules can cause stress and burnout.
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies, break tasks into smaller milestones, and prioritize workload effectively.

5.Security Vulnerabilities – Software can be exposed to security risks.
Strategy: Implement secure coding practices, perform regular security audits, and use encryption techniques.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly.
Its importance is that it detects bugs early, improves code quality, and simplifies debugging.

2.Integration Testing – Verifies that different modules or services work together as expected.
Its importance is that ensures smooth interaction between components and detects integration issues.

3.System Testing – Evaluates the complete software system against requirements.
Its importance is that it checks overall functionality, performance, and compliance with specifications.

4.Acceptance Testing – Confirms if the software meets business and user requirements.
Its importance is that it ensures readiness for deployment and validates that the software satisfies user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importances are:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article on how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including its benefits, challenges, and future potential."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clarity – Specifies the exact topic (AI in healthcare) rather than the broad term "technology."
Specificity – Outlines key areas to cover (benefits, challenges, future potential).
Conciseness – Provides a word limit (500 words) to guide the response.
Purpose – Ensures the writer focuses on a meaningful discussion relevant to the prompt.
